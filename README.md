<h1>Jaxon's Jewelry</h1>
<p>
This website demonstrates my knowledge of PHP. The headers, footers, and styles are all imported to the pages using PHP. All the forms on the site are created using PHP. The events form takes the information entered into the form, puts it into a database, and then displays that information on a separate page in a table. The table displays parts of all the information that has been entered from the database.<p>
